# Challange1-Refactoring

* **User Story**:

    AS a marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

* **Acceptance Criteria**:

    The structure of the HTML elements meets the HTML semantic structure.

    HTML elements structure follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

    Icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes.

    Headding attributes fall in sequential order.

    The Title is descriptive
